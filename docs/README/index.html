<h1>future-past</h1>
<p>This is an attempt at a reader for a course at Sydney University</p>
<p>It's some markdown files in <code>_posts</code> that are merged into one big file through <code>index.hmtl</code> with a liquid loop.</p>
<p>It's paginated with paged.js</p>
<h2>To build</h2>
<!--
1. clone the repo
1. run `bundle install`
1. run `jekyll serve --incremental`
1. it's probably being served on `http://localhost:4000/` -->
<ol>
<li><code>npx npx eleventy --input=. --output=docs --serve</code></li>
</ol>
<p>That should be it, but I've probably forgotten something</p>
